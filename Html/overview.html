            </header>

            <p>
                The tobacco epidemic is one of the biggest public health threats the world has ever faced, killing more
                than 8 million people a year. More than 7 million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use
                while around 1.2 million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke.

                Around 80% of the 1.1 billion smokers worldwide live in low- and middle-income countries, where the
                burden of tobacco-related illness and death is heaviest.

                Tobacco users who die prematurely deprive their families of income, raise the cost of healthcare and
                hinder economic development.

                In some countries, children from poor households are frequently employed in tobacco farming to provide
                family income. These children are especially vulnerable to "green tobacco sickness", which is caused by
                the nicotine that is absorbed through the skin from the handling of wet tobacco leaves.

                Good monitoring tracks the extent and character of the tobacco epidemic and indicates how best to tailor
                policies. Only 1 in 3 countries, representing 39% of the world's population, monitors tobacco use by
                repeating nationally representative youth and adult surveys at least once every 5 years.

                Second-hand smoke is the smoke that fills restaurants, offices or other enclosed spaces when people burn
                tobacco products such as cigarettes, bidis and water-pipes. There are more than 4000 chemicals in
                tobacco smoke, of which at least 250 are known to be harmful and more than 50 are known to cause cancer.
                <br>
                <br>
                There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke.
                <br>

                <ol>
                    <li><span class = "number">1. </span>In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including

                Every person should be able to breathe tobacco-smoke-free air. Smoke-free laws protect the health of
                non-smokers, are popular, do not harm business and encourage smokers to quit.
                <br>
                <br>
                Over 1.4 billion people, or <i><u>20%</u></i> of the world's population, are protected by comprehensive
                national smoke-free laws.

            </header>
            <p>
                Studies show that few people understand the specific health risks of tobacco use. For example, a 2009
                survey in China revealed that only 38% of smokers knew that smoking causes coronary heart disease and
                only 27% knew that it causes stroke.
                <br>
                <br>
                Among smokers who are aware of the dangers of tobacco, most want to quit. Counselling and medication can
                more than double the chance that a smoker who tries to quit will succeed.
                <br>
                <br>
                National comprehensive cessation services with full or partial cost-coverage are available to assist
                tobacco users to quit in only 26 countries, representing 33% of the world's population.

            <p>
                    Hard-hitting anti-tobacco advertisements and graphic pack warnings – especially those that include pictures – reduce the number of children who begin smoking and increase the number of smokers who quit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Graphic warnings can persuade smokers to protect the health of non-smokers by smoking less inside the home and avoiding smoking near children. Studies carried out after the implementation of pictorial package warnings in Brazil, Canada, Singapore and Thailand consistently show that pictorial warnings significantly increase people's awareness of the harms of tobacco use
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>78 countries</b>, representing 47% of the world's population, meet the best practice for pictorial warnings, which includes the warnings in the local language and cover an average of at least half of the front and back of cigarette packs.

            <p>
                    Tobacco taxes are the most cost-effective way to reduce tobacco use, especially among young and poor people. A tax increase that increases tobacco prices by <u><b>10% decreases</b></u> tobacco consumption by about <b>4%</b> in high-income countries and about <b>5%</b> in low- and middle-income countries.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even so, high tobacco taxes is a measure that is rarely implemented. Only <u><b>32 countries</b></u>, with <b>10%</b> of the world's population, have introduced taxes on tobacco products so that more than <b>75%</b> of the retail price is tax. Tobacco tax revenues are on average <b>250 times</b> higher than spending on tobacco control, based on available data.

                <h2>Illicit trade of tobacco products must be stopped</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
            The illicit trade in tobacco products poses major health, economic and security concerns around the world. It is estimated that 1 in every 10 cigarettes and tobacco products consumed globally is illicit. The illicit market is supported by various players, ranging from petty peddlers to organized criminal networks involved in arms and human trafficking.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tax avoidance (licit) and tax evasion (illicit) undermine the effectiveness of tobacco control policies, particularly higher tobacco taxes. These activities range from legal actions, such as purchasing tobacco products in lower tax jurisdictions, to illegal ones such as smuggling, illicit manufacturing and counterfeiting.
            <br>
            <br>
            The tobacco industry and others often argue that high tobacco product taxes lead to tax evasion. However, the evidence shows that non-tax factors including weak governance, high levels of corruption, poor government commitment to tackling illicit tobacco, ineffective customs and tax administration, and informal distribution channels for tobacco products are often of equal or greater importance.
            <br>
            <br>
            There is broad agreement that control of illicit trade benefits tobacco control and public health and result in broader benefits for governments. Critically, this will reduce premature deaths from tobacco use and raise tax revenue for governments. Stopping illicit trade in tobacco products is a health priority, and is achievable. But to do so requires improvement of national and sub-national tax administration systems and international collaboration. The WHO FCTC Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade of Tobacco Products (ITP) is the key supply side policy to reduce tobacco use and its health and economic consequences.
            <br>
            <br>
            While publicly stating its support for action against the illicit trade, the tobacco industry’s behind-the-scenes behaviour has been very different. Internal industry documents released as a result of court cases demonstrate that the tobacco industry has actively fostered the illicit trade globally. It also works to block implementation of tobacco control measures, such as tax increases and pictorial health warnings, by misleadingly arguing they will fuel the illicit trade.
            <br>
            <br>
            Experience from many countries demonstrate that illicit trade can be successfully addressed even when tobacco taxes and prices are raised, resulting in increased tax revenues and reduced tobacco use. Implementing and enforcing strong measures to control illicit trade enhances the effectiveness of significantly increased tobacco taxes and prices, as well as strong tobacco control policies, in reducing tobacco use and its health and economic consequences.

            </header>
            <p>
            WHO is committed to fighting the global tobacco epidemic. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) entered into force in February 2005 and has today 181 Parties covering more than 90% of the world's population   
            <br>
            <br>
            The WHO FCTC is a milestone in the promotion of public health. It is an evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of people to the highest standard of health, provides legal dimensions for international health cooperation and sets high standards for compliance.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 2008, WHO introduced a practical, cost-effective way to scale up implementation of the main demand reduction provisions of the WHO FCTC on the ground: MPOWER. Each MPOWER measure corresponds to at least 1 provision of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
            <br>
            <br>
            The 6 MPOWER measures are:

            <br>
            <br>
            The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products requires a wide range of measures relating to the tobacco supply chain, including the licensing of imports, exports and manufacture of tobacco products; the establishment of tracking and tracing systems and the imposition of penal sanctions on those responsible for illicit trade. It would also criminalize illicit production and cross-border smuggling. The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, the first Protocol to the Convention, was adopted in November 2012 at the fifth session of the Conference of the Parties in Seoul, Republic of Korea, and came into force in June 2018.
